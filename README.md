# Improve a Django Project
We need you to go through this project, find where it's inefficient, and fix it. Check the templates for bad inheritance and extra database calls. Check the views for extra views or extra database calls. Check the models to make sure they're using the best fields. Check the forms for proper validation and fields. Basically just check the whole thing over. Oh, and it doesn't have any tests, so please get test coverage up to at least 75%.

Use the provided `requirements.txt` to install needed packages for this project in a virtual environment.

### Start Application
After installing Django and required packages, please run the following command in your virutal environment:

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```
